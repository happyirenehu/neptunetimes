                <h6>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement. </h6>
                <p>Neptune Times is a news website which provides the latest news and articles.  The main idea is to give the reader a place to read the news and can easily access the “content”, with top stories and highlights box readers can enjoy the newspaper-alike reading experience.  So to keep the site clean and user friendly, the home page and news page doesn't offer additional animation or overlay. By only keeping the essential features the loading time can be minimized. I added some animation though in the subscribe section, also a detect current location feature. </p>

                <h6>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include
                guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc. </h6>
                <p>The websites that inspired me include Time Magazine, New York Times, BBC News, The Economist, The New England Journal of Medicine. And the </p>

               <h6>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible. </h6>
                <li>Mobile phone</li>
                Desktop/PC
                Tablet
                 
                CSS:
                Set font size using rem, so it’ll be responsive to fit different devices and screen sizes.
                Added hover effect with pricing table.

                State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.
                Easy to access: Keep the essential information with the minimal number of pages for all age groups of the users to navigate around easily. 
                Responsive design - Mobile phone, desktop and tablet friendly:  Avoid using images to display important information and minimize the animation and decoration. Leave enough blank space and space between paragraphs.
                Content focus: Avoid unnecessary overlay, animation, decoration and anything that could slow down the loading time while maintaining a pleasant and user-friendly interface. Make sure the website can be functional in the regular way at a lower internet speed.


                State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).
                I used to build websites by implementing templates completely, usually only doing minor changes such as text, pictures and CSS alterations. But this time I tried to analyze and build the layout from the structure. 
                I choose Bootstrap as I can easily alter the size with built-in attributes such as responsive iframe, grid system. I built the layout of the news content page using a grid system from Bootstrap inspired by Time magazine and The New York Times’ layout. The home page is taking the template from Bootstrap theme and I added the three columns news grids, Video grids and carousel slider.  In the subscribe page I called the Javacript Dom to generate the location and a function to show the price for discount bundle price.   

                I am also experiencing certain CSS attributes that can not be altered under Bootstrap structure. With the Card feature, the style I reference from the source seems to overwrite the style sheet in my folder. But I still don’t quite understand why the hover effect worked in my stylesheet though. After carefully reading the documentation I understand the border function had already been written in the CSS, I’ll just need to change the attribute in <div class=”border-the color I need”>, then the colour would change.The width is also already written, just add “w-the width I need”. No need to alter in the CSS file, but if there’s need I can still do it using custom style.

                What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? I learned how to write a cleaner code, less animation, less loading time, also how to work on the existing code and make it the way I wanted. I used to like to work on the existing template and alter them, but this time I tried to build the structure and grid of my own. The content 


                What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?   I feel like I will alter some attributes to javascript, it’ll need much less code to generate similar items. It’ll make the code much more readable and less messy. I used modal and manually added information for the 3 other subscriptions options. I

                What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.

                Taking things from the web
                You can use almost anything you like that you can find on the Web, but you should avoid
                anything that is not open (e.g. that costs money or requires login or registration), or
                anything from sites belonging to commercial companies. Being able to re-use other people's
                ideas is an important web skill. However, it is essential that, on your report page, you
                describe what you have taken, where you took it from, and what you have done to it. If you
                copy-and-paste something almost without change, you must say that you have done it, it
                must conform to the standards, and you shouldn't expect many marks for it, except for how
                you have made it fit in with and enhance your own design. To get more marks you can use
                code from elsewhere, document the source of the code in your report.html and then edit it
                in some way. Showing you can adapt existing code will earn you more marks. In order to be
                clear which material you have written and which you have used from elsewhere you will be
                expected to provide comprehensive comments within your HTML, CSS and Javascript files
                indicating code you have used, code you have adopted and edited and code that you have
                written.
